Predicting Diabetes using Logistic Regression on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset using Logistic Regression.
steps i have performed are:
1.Import the dataset
2.Check wether the datset contains zeroes or not.
3.Data Cleaning-If there are zeroes present in data replace them with mean for better Accuracy 
4.Data Exploration - Checked correlations and distributions.
5.Train-Test-Split - Split data into training and testing sets.
6.Model Building – Applied Logistic Regression.
7.Model Evaluation– Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report.
